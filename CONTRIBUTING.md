# Conventions

## Branches

1. Working on `master` is **forbidden**.
You should always work *on your own branches.*
2. Each branch name will begin with the type of changes:
* `feat/` - Adding new features to the project.
* `fix/` - Bug fixes.
* `refactor/` - Rewriting code.
* `style/` - Reformatting code.
* `chore/` - Maintenance of the project (Build script files, etc).
* `docs/` - Adding project documentation.
Aftet the `/` character, you will write in **Kebab case** the name of the branch. Keep it short and focus on the main subject changes (`this-is-kebab-case`)

Example:
* `feat/congestion-tests`
* `fix/zookeeper-disconnect`
* `refactor/manufacturing-locks`
